    "## RL as a blackbox optimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of looking at the value functions $Q$ and $V$ we can look directly at the policy. We assume our policy is parameterized by some vector $\\theta$ and try to optimize the reward by changing the values of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have some background in calculus, your instinct would tell you to use the gradient of the reward and update the parameter in the direction of this gradient!\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradients, however, are usually bad news for reinforcement learning. One issue is rewards that are far in the future, but perhaps the most serious downside is that the total reward function is very sensitive to the parameter. Imagine that you had a situation were you want to train a model, for instance, linear regression, on your dataset, and that the data would change every time you change the parameter! This makes the situation rather tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there is a large class of optimization methods that do not use of the gradients and some of those are easy to parallelize. We will discuss two methods which have shown promising results. Other variations of heuristic methods (for instance, genetic algorithms) could also be applied.\n"
